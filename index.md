## Detection Content
 - [Splunk Detection Research](https://research.splunk.com/detections/) - 1170 (at time of writing) Splunk Analytics built to find evil. Great detection repository.
 - [Hijackable Libraries / GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/hijacklibs.csv) - CSV of Hijackable Windows DLLs provided by Splunk.
## Offensive Security
- [PIMPMyKali / GitHub](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) - Run on new Kali VMs. This will configure alot of the items required for functionality (E.g. fix the python module issue, etc).
- [Impacket / GitHub](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) - Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Tools in this suite are commonly used by attackers to execute code/commands on remote systems.
- [Basic Linux Privilege Escalation](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) - Basic Linux Privilege Escalation from G0tmi1k. 
- [Windows Privilege Escalation Fundamentals](https://fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html) - Windows Privilege Escalation Fundamentals from FuzzySecurity.
- [Windows-Privesc-Check / Tool](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check) - Windows-privesc-check is standalone executable that runs on Windows systems. It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).


### OSCP Specific
- [S1REN's Proving Ground Walkthroughs / YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJrSyRNlZ2EeqkJa12Tu-Ezun9kXvHufN) - S1REN works for Offensive Security and has been instructing some of their classes. She is an amazing penetration tester and in this video playlist she walks through exploitation of Proving Ground machines. The methology here can be trasnfered over to PWK & OSCP.
